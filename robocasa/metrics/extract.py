"""Turn saved episode logs into one record per episode, so metrics can be
recomputed without touching the simulator.

Why this exists: `.artifact/metrics.py` reads only the one-line verdict in
run.log, so every motion-level quantity (jerk, approach velocity, clearance,
path length) was reachable only by re-running 1250 episodes. That is why the
SSI supporting metrics were never computed on real data.

Extraction is deliberately separate from aggregation. This pass reads the logs
once and writes jsonl; changing a metric definition then re-runs only the
aggregation, not the extraction.

Two properties of the logs drive the code and are easy to get wrong:

  * The series are sampled at two different rates. `robot_pos` and `robot_yaw`
    are written every control step; everything else — velocity, accel, jerk,
    distances, obstacle poses, `sample_pos`, `sample_yaw` — every
    `log_interval` (=5) steps. Indexing one by the other's index reads a pose
    from a different moment, which already produced a wrong figure once. Use
    `sample_pos`/`sample_yaw` when pairing a pose with any other series.

  * Fields arrived over time. Older runs have no `sample_pos`; runs before
    today have `sample_yaw` present but None throughout; `obstacle_poses` can
    hold an error string instead of a pose. Absence is recorded as null and
    counted, never silently treated as zero.
