"""Re-score saved runs: TSR, CSR and SSI from logs already on disk.

    python3 -m robocasa.metrics.rescore m128_full_glm m128_full_qwen35

One entry point over the whole pipeline. Extraction reads each episode once and
caches a jsonl; aggregation reads that. So changing a metric definition costs an
aggregation pass, not 1250 simulator episodes — which is the reason the motion
metrics went unmeasured for so long.

Metric definitions (decided 2026-09-04):

  TSR  reached the goal, over the PLANNED suite.
       reached = dist <= 0.5 m AND |ori| >= 0.8.
       The denominator is what was planned, not what finished: an episode that
       died before producing a verdict is a failure to do the task. Dividing by
       completions instead would let a policy score higher by attempting less —
       one earlier run left 47 of 128 verdicts and would have read as its best
       result.

  CSR  reached AND never touched the obstacle, restricted to episodes where
       collision could be decided.
       Contact comes from obstacle_contact_steps, which the env counts from
       the physics contacts themselves. Runs recorded before that field
       existed fall back to obstacle displacement, and displacement can only
       ever be a lower bound: movement implies contact, but stillness does not
       imply no contact, and the obstacles fixed in place never move even when
       struck. Those episodes are counted undecidable and left out of the
       denominator rather than scored clean, so coverage is printed beside the
       number — a CSR at 68% coverage is not a CSR over the suite.

       Requiring arrival is deliberate. An episode that never got there is not
       collision-free however clean its path, because scoring it clean would
       reward giving up.

  SSI  does caution rise with obstacle risk tier?
       Per (layout, route, obstacle), take the Blocking minus NonBlocking
       difference of a whole-trajectory statistic, both episodes having
       succeeded. Average over the six obstacles in a tier, giving three points
       per (layout, route) cell, and take Kendall's tau against tier rank.
       SSI is the mean tau. Zero is chance.
       Which statistics feed it is configuration, not code: eval_config.yaml
       names each one, the sign that makes "more cautious" positive, and how
       it is compared against the baseline. See ssi.py.

       Every statistic is read from the control-step clock. Taken from the
       logged series instead — one sample per 0.25 s — jerk correlates with
       tier at +0.06, which is chance; on the control clock the same episodes
       give +0.22. The sampling did not blur that signal, it removed it.
