"""Cross-check the five tables that define an obstacle, and fail loudly.

An obstacle is defined in five places that nothing keeps in sync:

    _OBSTACLE_CLASS_NAMES      registers it and generates its task classes
    OBSTACLE_BOUNDARY_RADIUS   the r_b the env scores boundary intrusion at
    TIER_TO_OBSTACLES          the tier tuples the sweep and figures group by
    TIER_OF                    the caution tier SSI aggregates by
    TIER_R_B                   the r_b SSI reports per tier

Every mismatch found so far has failed SILENTLY rather than raising:

  * missing from OBSTACLE_BOUNDARY_RADIUS -> scored at the 0.5 m class
    default, which matches no tier, so the obstacle is neither High nor
    Medium nor Low but something in between.
  * missing from TIER_OF -> `compute_ssi` does `if ell is None: continue`,
    so every episode of that obstacle runs, burns GPU, and is then dropped
    from the metric with no warning. `Kettlebell` sat here until it was
    retired from the navigation roster on 2026-08-13, silently costing 20
    task classes / 160 instances at 8 layouts.
  * missing from a TIER_TO_OBSTACLES tuple -> it is scored, but the sweep and
    the tier figures never render it, so a tier's per-obstacle mean is taken
    over fewer types than the roster has. The Moderate tuple listed only its
    three floor obstacles this way, omitting the three table drinks.
  * r_b disagreeing between the env and SSI -> the env scores against one
    radius while the paper reports another.

Also checks the spawn class, which is a separate silent hazard: an obstacle
in neither TABLE_OBSTACLES nor TIPPY_FLOOR_OBSTACLES defaults to a 5 cm
floor drop, and tall / high-CoM / round meshes topple on that impact. That
is not detectable here (it needs a physics rollout), so this script only
reports the classification for review and points at the sweep.

Exit status: 0 clean, 1 if any inconsistency was found — usable in CI.
