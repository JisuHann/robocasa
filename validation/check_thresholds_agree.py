"""The environment and the scorer must use the same arrival test.

They did not. The env scored at 0.6 m, and at 0.9 m when the target was the
human, while eval_config.yaml — which the re-scoring reads — said 0.5 m. Over a
finished 1250-episode run that gap flipped 33 verdicts and moved TSR by 2.6
points, decided entirely by which side did the scoring. Nothing reported the
disagreement, because each side was self-consistent.

The human exception was the worse half: it scored the most dangerous obstacle
in the roster most leniently. Stopping 0.9 m short of a person counted as
arrival while stopping 0.6 m short of a bin did not.

This walks real environments rather than reading the constant, so a per-task
adjustment reintroduced anywhere still fails here.
